## lab6 : Inheritance and Interface
#### Approach
In this lab, I created two class Restaurant and Review. The relation between Restaurant and Review is one to many. Because one restaurant can have multiple reviews. 

#### Test 
The purpose of my testing is to test the association between two classes. 
##### Methods
```
toString()
addReview()
updateStarsOfRestaurant()
```

## lab7 : Inheritance, day 2
#### Approach 
1. Create three new classes Shop, Theater, and ReviewMovie
2. ReviewMovie extends the Review class
3. All the basic functionalism's of classes are tested

##### Methods 
```
toString()
addReviewShop()
```
